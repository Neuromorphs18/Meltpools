# Meltpools

A simple 2 layer siamese convnet trained with contrastive loss with the purpose of 
learning embeddings to classify gallium melt pools of different depths.

TODO's: 
  -Implement data augmentation to relieve any spurious effects of gallium droplets.
  -Train and test on different perturbations
